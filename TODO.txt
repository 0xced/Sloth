TODO list for Sloth 2.4
    DONE * Sloth now defaults to showing Mac-friendly process names (e.g. "Safari Web Content" instead of "com.apple.WebKit.WebContent"). Also, process names are no longer truncated to 32 characters.
    DONE * DNS to IP resolution and port name to integer in Info Panel when DNS/port lookup enabled in Prefs
    DONE * Fixed empty name bug for processes not owned by current user when friendly names are disabled
    DONE * Show file descriptor integer in Info window
    * Show process icon in "Used by" in Info Panel
    * Prefer IPv4 address when resolving DNS name in Info Panel (e.g. not ::1 for localhost)
    * Show in Finder for unix sockets on file system
    * Run "file" command on unix sockets and char devices on file system
